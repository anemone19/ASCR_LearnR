<h2>4 Overview of aSCR</h2>
<p>So far, we have investigated distance-dependent detection and briefly
looked over the structure of an SCR model in the context of acoustic
sampling. The underlying principle of SCR is to model the spatial
distribution of animals using a predefined spatial density model. This
model describes the spatial point pattern of animal locations within the
survey region. On the other hand, the detection function describes the
probability of detecting an animal based on its distance from the
detector. By combining these two components with a habitat mask, SCR
models estimate density within a defined survey region while accounting
for the spatial variation in detection probability. When we use an SCR
model for acoustic surveys, we refer to it as acoustic spatial
capture-recapture or aSCR for short.</p>
<p>There is an important distinction to make before we can move on to
acoustic data analysis. In the frog example of Chapter 1, we assumed
each frog made one call so we could equate a detected call with one
individual frog. Rarely does an individual, let alone all individuals in
a population, call only once during a survey, and it’s not always
possible to match calls to individuals. In other words, we can’t
typically classify multiple detected calls as belonging to one
individual. In that case, our density model describes the distribution
of <span style="color:#668BA4;font-weight:bold;">call locations</span>
and not <span style="color:#668BA4;font-weight:bold;">animal
locations</span> as we’ve described previously. Call locations are
simply the location from which a call was made. The aSCR model
implemented and the interpretation of the density estimate is different
depending on which type of location we are modelling, and that is
determined by the <span
style="color:#668BA4;font-weight:bold;">detection unit</span> of our
study.</p>
<p>The detection unit is simply the thing we record as having been
detected. The detection unit is a call if we only record calls and not
the animal the call belongs to. If we detect some calls from identified
animals, the detection unit is the animals. Animals may further be
distinguished as individuals or groups of animals, so we could detect
calls coming from individuals or groups of animals.</p>
<p><img src="images/detflow1.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The raw data that any acoustic survey collects are audio recordings
of the calls produced by the wildlife population. The recordings are
then typically processed via a computer program to isolate the calls of
the target species. For example, there is an open-source software
program called
<a href="http://www.pamguard.org/" target="_blank">PAMGAURD</a> that can
be used to identify calls of certain species. This cool technology was
first made for studying marine mammal sounds, but it has also been used
in many studies to identify the calls of the Cape Moss frog’s croaks.
Automated sound identification procedures, including complex machine
learning algorithms and statistical models, are complicated and varied.
These are not the focus of this tutorial, but if you’d like to know more
about detecting and classifying acoustic signals or just the use of
passive acoustics in ecological monitoring,
<a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13101" target="_blank">this</a>
is a cool paper to read.</p>
<p>The recording devices used in acoustic surveys typically also record
other information with audio recordings, called metadata. Two common
types of extra information are the strength of the received acoustic
signal (i.e. the call) and the time that the call was detected, referred
to as <span style="color:#668BA4;font-weight:bold;">signal
strength</span> and <span style="color:#668BA4;font-weight:bold;">time
of arrival</span> data, respectively. So each isolated call may have an
associated signal strength and/or arrival time attached to it. In some
situations, estimated distances and directions to sound sources may be
collected as well. We can include these measurements in our analysis to
help our model estimate the likely locations of detected calls and,
consequently, improve density estimates. We’ll explore this further in
the next chapter.</p>
<div id="section-calling-density" class="section level3">
<h3>Calling Density</h3>
<p>At this point, the data can be analysed on the call level (i.e. with
a call as the detection unit) with an aSCR model that models call
locations. Consequently, our density estimate is <span
style="color:#668BA4;font-weight:bold;">calling density</span> - the
number of calls per unit area per unit time. We call this model aSCR-CD
for short, where CD stands for calling density.</p>
<p>If we want to convert calling density to animal density, we have to
know the average call rate of our target species. We could use the
average call rate from previous studies or independently collect data to
estimate the call rate ourselves.</p>
<p><img src="images/detflow2.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div id="section-animal-or-group-density" class="section level3">
<h3>Animal (or Group) Density</h3>
<p>Identities of animals are never directly observed in acoustic surveys
- but if we can match detected calls to individual animals or groups of
animals, we can model animal or group locations and consequently,
estimate <span style="color:#668BA4;font-weight:bold;">animal or group
density</span> directly. Hence the model name, ascr-AD/GD. Our detection
unit is then an animal or a group of animals, depending on the nature of
the target species.</p>
<p>If you’re confused about the difference between call and animal
locations, this might help: in the aSCR-AD/GD model, we assume that the
detection units strictly <strong>do not move</strong> between calls
which is another way of saying calls from one animal or group come from
the same location. In the aSCR-CD model, we don’t make any assumptions
about movement between calls, so animals may or may not move between
calls.</p>
<p>Data pre-processing starts as in aSCR-CD; we have to isolate the
species’ calls from the raw data. However, we have to somehow classify
calls as belonging to specific individuals or groups.</p>
<p><img src="images/detflow3.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>This particular aSCR model was developed relatively recently (in
2021), and presently, procedures to distinguish individual animals or
groups from acoustic data remain unattainable for most taxa. Even in
cases where it is feasible, accomplishing this task demands a lot of
hands-on work and may have considerable uncertainty attached to
individual identities. Similar to call identification, automated
procedures using machine learning techniques are likely to emerge in the
near future, and when they do, the aSCR-AD/GD model will be the way to
go for density estimation (unless calling density is of specific
interest).</p>
<p>Under the aSCR-AD/GD and aSCR-CD model, we assume that all
individuals or groups called at least once during the survey and either
detect those calls or not. Typically, there is no reason to think
otherwise, and we can implement a straightforward aSCR survey and the
aSCR-AD/GD model as is to estimate animal or group density.</p>
<p><img src="images/detflow4.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
</div>
<div
id="section-animal-or-group-density-with-additional-data-collection"
class="section level3">
<h3>Animal (or Group) Density with additional data collection</h3>
<p>If, however, there are clear reasons why some might definitely not
have called even once during our survey occasion, we have to either
estimate an additional parameter (similar to the idea of estimating the
call rate in aSCR-CD) or adjust our survey structure.</p>
<p>For example, gibbons (Family Hylobatidae) occur in groups that engage
in duetted singing and not all groups will sing daily. The singing
frequency between and within groups may also differ due to
weather-related changes. A typical survey occasion might be two hours in
the morning when gibbons are likely to sing, so this assumption is
violated because we know not all groups sing in a single day. You might
be thinking that why could we not increase our survey length? Well, it
is likely impossible to increase it to such an extent that the
assumption holds. In this case, making the survey length a whole day
would not solve the problem, likely even two or three days either and
then we could also likely be violating the assumption of a closed
population.</p>
<p>For species like this, we have to do a little bit more. We could
either stick with a single aSCR survey and then have to estimate
independently the proportion of times individuals or groups call. This
requires that human surveyors conduct focal follows of detected groups
or individuals over additional occasions to estimate the average
proportion of times the units vocalise. Alternatively, we can conduct
aSCR surveys on multiple occasions, which requires that individuals or
groups can be linked across occasions and that enough occasions are
chosen to ensure that each individual or group within the survey region
is likely to have called at least once. In Chapter 6, we will look at
these methods in more detail.</p>
<p><img src="images/detflow.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Putting all of that together, we can see the three main workflows of
acoustic SCR. The upcoming chapters will cover these analyses. We’ll
introduce the R package we will use and implement a simple aSCR model
for call locations (aSCR-CD). Then we will look at aSCR-CD when
additional information is included in the analysis. Next, we’ll look
into implementing the acoustic SCR model (aSCR-AD/GD) when we have
scaled our data to the animal or group level and can directly estimate
animal or group density (AD/GD). Lastly, we look at the aSCR-AD/GD model
when we cannot assume that all individuals or groups will call during a
single survey.</p>

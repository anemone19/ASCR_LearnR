<h2>2 Probability of detection</h2>
<p>In this tutorial, we assume that our wildlife population is closed.
This means that during our survey, we assume that no new individuals are
joining the population (births or immigration) or individuals leaving
the population (deaths or emigration). In other words, we assume
demographic and geographic closure. The alternative assumption is that
the population is open allowing for such changes in the population, but
this requires a different type of analysis that has not yet been
developed for acoustic surveys.</p>
<p>Regardless of our assumption, a key task is to estimate the <span
style="color:#668BA4;font-weight:bold;">probability of detection</span>
- the probability that any individual in the population gets detected at
all. This is because most surveys of wild populations are inherently
<strong>imperfect</strong>. When estimating animal abundance, the
probability of detection helps us know how many animals we did not
detect. Knowing the probability of being in our sample enables us to
determine the probability of NOT being in our sample. By estimating this
probability, we take into account <span
style="color:#668BA4;font-weight:bold;">imperfect detection</span> in
our analysis, which would otherwise have produced inaccurate
results.</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at a traditional capture-recapture analysis with an
example.</p>
<div id="section-example-the-cape-moss-frog" class="section level3">
<h3>Example: The Cape Moss Frog</h3>
<p>In the Cape Peninsula of South Africa, this nifty little frog lives
in leaf litter and among thickly vegetated mountain streams and river
banks. It’s the perfect specimen for acoustic surveying because despite
the frog being super tiny (about 20-22mm), it can often be heard by its
high-pitched call (although some people mistake it for a cricket).</p>
<p><img src="images/capemossfrog1.jpeg" width="35%" style=" display: block; margin: 1em auto; border-radius: 2.5%;" /></p>
<p>Let’s imagine we want to estimate this frog population’s abundance.
We place eight microphones throughout a patch of its habitat (see the
arrangement below). Let’s further imagine that we know the locations of
the frogs in that patch (click the “Reveal Frogs” button) and that they
each made one call. We may or may not detect (record) each of the calls
made, and our microphones can detect multiple calls - click the
“Survey!” button to see the resulting data collected.</p>
<p>The table below is a data frame consisting of <span
style="color:#668BA4;font-weight:bold;">detection histories</span>. Each
row is a detection history of a call made and indicates at which
microphone the call was recorded. An entry equal to “1” means that the
call (i.e. row) was recorded at that microphone (i.e. column), and if
not, the entry will be a zero. Click on one of the rows to show you the
frog location and the microphones that detected the call. To get back to
the original plot, just unclick the row.</p>
<p>Below the detection history data, you’ll also see the actual number
of frogs (<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>), an estimate of the
overall probability of detection (<span
class="math inline">\(p^*\)</span>) and an estimate of abundance that
was calculated as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{Estimate of N} = \frac{\text{number of detected frogs}}{p^*}
\]</span> In the above formula, we are correcting for the number of
frogs we missed by dividing by the overall probability of detecting an
individual during the survey - that is, the probability of ever
detecting an individual across all the microphones. To obtain <span
class="math inline">\(p^*\)</span>, we first calculate the probability
of detecting an individual at a microphone (<span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>) which we can calculate as the
proportions of times we detected an individual (i.e. the proportion of
1s in our whole dataset). Then, the probability of missing an individual
at a microphone is one minus <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. But
we have eight microphones, so the probability of missing an individual
that many times is: <span class="math inline">\((1-p)^8\)</span> and the
complement of that is <span class="math inline">\(p^* =
1-(1-p)^8\)</span>, the overall probability of detection.</p>

<p>Play around a bit, conduct multiple surveys on the same set of frogs
or survey new sets of frogs a few times! You’ll likely notice that our
abundance estimate is usually lower than the actual number of frogs. In
fact, if you click the “Repeat x 1000” button, 1000 surveys of your
current frog population will be conducted and the resulting 1000
estimates will be visualized as a histogram.</p>
<p>Immediately, it is clear the peak of the histogram is relatively far
away from the true value, which tells us that most of the time, we’re
estimating that a smaller number of frogs exist within this habitat
patch. If you’re familiar with statistical terminology, we have shown
through simulation that our estimate is negatively biased. We don’t want
this! Remember, our example is on a very arbitrary scale. In reality,
concluding that your population is much smaller than what actually
exists could lead to misleading decision-making and misplaced
conservation efforts.</p>
<p>So, what’s happening here? The basic CR model assumes constant
detection probability, so essentially, we’ve assume that each call is
equally likely to be detected. But is that true? If you have surveyed a
few times, you’ll see that frogs closer to the microphones are almost
always detected, and frogs within short distances to multiple
microphones get detected various times! The calls made by those frogs
are more likely (i.e. higher probability of detection) to be recorded
than those far away. That means our ability to detect calls depends on
distance; more specifically detection probability decreases with
increasing distance.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-distance-dependent-detection" class="section level3">
<h3>Distance-dependent detection</h3>
<p>Let’s focus on one hypothetical population of 25 frogs we’ve surveyed
once. We know the locations of all the frogs in our population, so we
can measure the straight line distance between each frog and each
microphone.</p>
<p>Click on any of the frogs below to see the Euclidean distances to
each microphone which will be displayed above the relevant microphone.
For example’s sake, we’ll say that we’ve measured distance in meters.
For frogs that were detected, the distances to the microphones that
picked up their call will be in green.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>We can plot a histogram of these distances (all 225 of them) and
inspect the frequency of distances within certain intervals (or bins). A
distance bin is the span of a bar - the first distance bin is from 0 to
10 meters, the second is from 10 to 20 meters and so forth. If you hover
over the bars, the frequency of frogs, i.e. how many of the distances
measured fall within that distance bin, is shown.</p>
<p>One frog is in our first distance bin (0 to 10 meters), five in the
second, twelve in the third and so forth. As is, it’s not an extremely
interesting graph. But if we add the distances between detected frogs
and the microphones they were detected at, it starts to become a bit
more informative (Click ‘Add detections’).</p>
<p>Let’s make sure we understand this, every distance between every frog
and a microphone is measured and then included in the histogram below.
Then when we add the detections, the distances between detected frogs
and the relevant microphone or microphones - that is, the green
distances for all the frogs in the plot above.</p>

</div>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We can see that we detected the frog within the first distance bin
(so we detected 100% of frogs within 0 to 10 meters of a microphone),
and we missed only one frog in the second distance bin. The number of
frogs we missed starts to increase as our distance bins become larger
until we just didn’t detect any of the frogs anymore. So, as the
distances between frogs and microphones become more extensive, we start
to miss more and more frogs. In fact, the proportion of frogs detected
out of the total frogs gives us our probability of detection within each
distance bin (Click ‘Show proportions’). Now, we can clearly see how
detection probability decreases with distance!</p>
<p>In reality, we don’t know the locations of the animals we did or did
not detect, and we don’t know the exact shape of the relationship
between distance and the probability of detection. So, we need to assume
what we think these aspects look like. This is where spatial
capture-recapture comes in!</p>
<div class="learnBox">
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wildlife surveys are imperfect; we will never observe all the
individuals of a population during a survey - this is known as imperfect
detection.</li>
<li>For reliable abundance and density estimates, we must estimate the
probability of detection (the probability that any individual in the
population gets detected).</li>
<li>Capture-recapture studies produce data in the form of detection
histories (or capture histories), where an entry of “1” indicates that
the call was recorded and zero otherwise.</li>
<li>Traditional CR analysis produce abundance estimates that are smaller
than what actually exists, which may have serious consequences.</li>
<li>Assuming constant detection probability is unrealistic - detection
probability decreases with distance; the further away an animal is, the
harder it is to detect its calls.</li>
<li>We need to assume the shape of the relationship between distance and
detection probability because, in real life, we don’t know the locations
of the animals.</li>
